%- research problem / problem statement
%    - problem definition > define problem you will address (and why) in research
%        - context + background information > who has a problem, when/where does problem arise > what is the cause?
%        - specificity / scope > what you are trying to solve, what will not be tackled?
%        - relevance > why is important for society/profession to solve problem > what happens if not, who will feel consequences?
%    - problem statement > describe specific problem or issue within larger problem that needs / is relevant enough to be solved
%        - should indicate what problem is / where it is occurring
%        - must be single problem, explicitly stated, relevant
%- objective > why you are undertaking research, what you are specifically trying to achieve [6]
%    - goal is not to solve a problem, but should identify what study itself will achieve
%- main research question > what you are trying to determine with your study (derived from problem statement) > results are later used to answer problem statement [5]
%    - => example: [2]
%    - what is the basic question you are trying to answer through your research?
%    - break down main question in sub-questions that together answer main question > what more specific questions do you have to answer to be able to answer main research question?
%    - different research question types (descriptive, comparative etc.)
%- brief description of research design
%	- describe study design (part of research plan) > where, when, how (= research method/-ology > survey, experiment etc.), with whom
