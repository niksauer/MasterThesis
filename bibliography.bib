	abstract = {Web components improve Internet applications, empowering end-user development with encapsulation and interoperability. Public repositories contain a variety of web components implementing GUI elements, system components for mashup development and wrappers of popular web services. The distribution of this technology through public repositories has fostered a growing interest in quality metrics for web components, highlighting the absence of unified approach. This paper presents a reference model and evaluation framework for measuring the quality of web components. Preliminary results of an experimentation framework provide insights for comparing standard metrics with custom metrics based on curated user-perceived quality and data extracted from public repositories.},

	abstract = {The emerging Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm promises to enable businesses and organizations to collaborate in an unprecedented way by means of standard web services. To support rapid and dynamic composition of services in this paradigm, web services that meet requesters' functional requirements must be able to be located and bounded dynamically from a large and constantly changing number of service providers based on their Quality of Service (QoS). In order to enable quality-driven web service selection, we need an open, fair, dynamic and secure framework to evaluate the QoS of a vast number of web services. The fair computation and enforcing of QoS of web services should have minimal overhead but yet able to achieve sufficient trust by both service requesters and providers. In this paper, we presented our open, fair and dynamic QoS computation model for web services selection through implementation of and experimentation with a QoS registry in a hypothetical phone service provisioning market place application.},
