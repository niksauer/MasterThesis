# Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a System to Create a Data Set Supporting Research in the EnergieBroker Platform

The EnergieBroker Platform is a novel idea developed to make small-scale photovoltaic and wind turbine systems attractive even after they have become ineligible to receive a guaranteed feed-in tariff. To support the ongoing research in this undertaking, a data set shall be created which will detail how private households equipped with photovoltaic systems satisfy their energy demands and handle the excess amounts of energy produced. For this purpose, the thesis at hand will guide the reader through the process of designing an end-to-end software-based solution capable of autonomously reading and transmitting data from multiple geographically dispersed electricity and generation meters. Based on the blueprint presented herein, a production-grade implementation is carried out simultaneously and tested against a real set of households. Statistical analysis has shown that this system is highly reliable, while also validating conformance with the core functional requirements.
